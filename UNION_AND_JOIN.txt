	a:	SELECT lecturers.LecturerName FROM lecturers
		UNION ALL
		SELECT lecturers_new.LecturerName FROM lecturers_new;
				get 19 lines

	b:	SELECT lecturers.LecturerName FROM lecturers
		UNION
		SELECT lecturers_new.LecturerName FROM lecturers_new;
				get 18 lines

		the different between the two is, in query 1 we use "UNION ALL" so we get all including duplicate.
		in query 2 we use only "UNION" without ALL so we get result without duplicate values.
